# webhook-repo
This project is implemented using Pycharm, Flask, Mongodb(Atlas Cluster), Github, and Html. This project was completely developed in Virtual Environment.

# How to Setup the project.
## Preliminary Steps: Ensure the action-repo on GitHub is open, and fork this repository into another GitHub account. Also, have your MongoDB (Atlas Cluster) open.
1. Load the complete repository, except for the UI-program-Mongodb folder, into PyCharm (or a similar IDE) within a virtual environment.
2. Expose port 5000 to the world using Cloudflared instead of Ngrok. (Download the cloudflared-windows-amd64 file.)
3. Open CMD in user mode, navigate to the folder where the cloudflared-windows-amd64 file is stored, and run the command: .\cloudflared-windows-amd64.exe tunnel --url localhost:5000
4. This command will expose your localhost:5000 to the world, and a URL will be generated in CMD.
5. Copy the generated URL from CMD and paste it into the action-repo under Settings â†’ Webhook.
6. The URL to be pasted into the webhook should be in the following format: <generated_url>/webhook/receiver  Also, configure the webhook to trigger on Push and Pull Request actions.
7. Run the project (which will run on port 5000), and simultaneously load the UI-program-Mongodb folder in a new project, running it on port 5001.
8. Open the link generated by the UI-program-Mongodb project and monitor the results in MongoDB.
9. Start pushing and creating pull requests on the action-repo on GitHub. The project will handle everything, updating MongoDB, while the UI-program-Mongodb project will continuously fetch the latest data every 15 seconds.
